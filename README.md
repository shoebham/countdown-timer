# countdown-timer

Today i was going down the rabbit hole of internet and discovering cool sites, one site that i discovered was https://avanier.dev/

While going through the beautiful site I came acroos [this](https://lab.avanier.dev/countdown?from=2023-01-01&to=2023-12-31)
A very simple countdown timer, I thought to myself I can build that too in an hour and so I did but the code is not nearly half as elegant
as the original source. 

I still have a long way to go in writing better code.
